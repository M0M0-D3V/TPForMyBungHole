### Hello and welcome to a personal project I am working on with Ronan Relosa! This is meant to be a fun yet productive way to keep working on my understanding of MERN full stack and general app building. This project is in works currently and will be eventually be built for android and iOS. The purpose of this app is to be an effective price calculator and purchase tracker so that you don't spend more than you need to on toilet paper!

#### Originally, we would just use this basic excel sheet to do multiple calculations as we were shooping for toilet paper, but then the idea came up what if we can save the history of what was typed in as well as keep track of purchases? And so the push for an app version was born!
